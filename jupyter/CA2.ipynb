    "==========================================================================================================================\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this project we use mthods based on nature and natural selection. <br>\n",
    "The methods are called Geneteics algorithm. The algorithm is inspired <br>\n",
    "by Natural concepts like mating, genetic mutation and natural selection.<br>\n",
    "In Genetic algorithm there are points that need to be considered. <br>\n",
    "Insufficient population may cause poor operation of algorithm. Actually<br>\n",
    "to reach the complete answers population size should be coherent to <br>\n",
    "number of possible answers. The smaller the population the greater the<br>\n",
    "likehood of omitting of variety. But increasing population without <br>\n",
    "attention may cause poor performance of algorithm. <br>\n",
    "So there should be a equilibrium point for this.<br>\n",
    "From a practical point of view, Genetics algorithms are used in problems<br>\n",
    "with huge space of states. <br>\n",
    "## Project description\n",
    "In this project we to find gates of a logic circuit using Genetics algorithms<br>\n",
    "In such a way that its output corresponds to the truth table. The circuit is<br>\n",
    "made using 9 gates and we are to find those 9 gates. <br>\n",
    "The truth table is a csv file which has 11 columns and 1024 rows. First 10<br>\n",
    "columns are inputs of circuit and last column is its output. <br>\n",
    "We have 1024 rows because by 10 inputs 2^10 different cases are possible<br>\n",
    "for circuit inputs.\n",
    "## Phase 1\n",
    "### Genetics concepts in this project\n",
    "### Chromosome\n",
    "The answer of this problem is list consecutive gates<br>\n",
    "A chromosome describe a possible answer for our problem. <br>\n",
    "So a chromosome made by 9 consiquence gates. Number of <br>\n",
    "chromosomes construct the population.<br>\n",
    "### Gene\n",
    "Every chromosome is made by number of genes. <br>\n",
    "A gene represent a property<br> \n",
    "In our case every gene in a chromosome represent<br>\n",
    "a gate in the ciruit. Actually every gate is considered<br>\n",
    "as a property of the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 2\n",
    "### Creating initial population\n",
    "Generating initial population is the first action in genetic<br>\n",
    "algorithm. Each chromosome in the population is made randomly.<br>\n",
    "And no bias existed. The population contain 1000 chromosomes.<br>\n",
    "This number is a equilibrium point. Its huge enough to be sure<br>\n",
    "that algorithm find the answer and does not stuck in local maximums.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 3\n",
    "### Fitness\n",
    "For every chromosome its fitness is number of rows(in truth table)<br>\n",
    "which their output is same as output of chromosome gates(genes) <br>\n",
    "Our desired chromsome has fitness of 1024.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 4\n",
    "### Crossover\n",
    "Crossover is representation of mating in natural case. <br>\n",
    "In crossover by specified probability parents (2 chromosome)<br>\n",
    "create 2 children. Each child inherit some genes from parent 1<br>\n",
    "and some from parent 2. If child 1 inherit a specific gene<br>\n",
    "from parent 1, child 2 inherit them from parent 2.\n",
    "### Mutation\n",
    "Mutation is represent of mutation in natural case. <br>\n",
    "In mutation every chromosome by a specific change <br>\n",
    "sees one of its genes altered. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 5\n",
    "### Questions\n",
    "### 1\n",
    "Fitness of a chromosome describe how much ideal it is <br>\n",
    "By fitnesses desired chromsomes and unwilling chromosomes<br>\n",
    "are distinguishable. Number of matched outputs of a chromsome<br>\n",
    "by truth table describe how good it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2\n",
    "We do ranked-based selection in this algorithm. Values of<br>\n",
    "fitnesses of chromosomes may differ considerably and choosing<br>\n",
    "it as weight for probability in selection may cause biased <br>\n",
    "selection and not achieving varity. In fact it may cause some<br>\n",
    "chromosomes to get a very big probability to be select compared<br>\n",
    "to the rest.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3\n",
    "Crossover and mutation can evolve the population and emerge <br>\n",
    "strong and diverse candidates. <br>\n",
    "#### Probability of chrossover:\n",
    "average of fitnesses of population divided by population size.<br>\n",
    "##### reason:\n",
    "As the population evolves average of fitnesses of it increase <br>\n",
    "and stronger candidates appear. So probability of crossover <br>\n",
    "decrease to not losing strong candidates.\n",
    "#### Probability of mutation:\n",
    "1 divided by population size.\n",
    "##### reason:\n",
    "The Pprobability of mutation is highly affected by population size.<br>\n",
    "The bigger the population the more number of various candidates. <br>\n",
    "So the chance of mutation becomes less. And the smaller the population<br>\n",
    "the less number of various candidates. So we need diverse candidates to <br>\n",
    "be emerged.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4\n",
    "Sometimes our population evolves and reach a high average fitness<br>\n",
    "but they are not divers and the algorithm does not find a way to <br>\n",
    "final optimal answer.\n",
    "To solve this problem increasing population could be helpfull to bring<br>\n",
    "diversity to population. Increasing crossover probability and mutation<br>\n",
    "probability could be helpfull to. It may lead the population to have <br>\n",
    "various candidates.\n",
